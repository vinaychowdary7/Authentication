#MERN Stack Authentication Application
This project is a full-stack authentication application built using the `MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack`. It features a responsive design with smooth, animated transitions between login and signup pages, enhancing the user experience. The backend, developed with Node.js and Express, manages user authentication, including signup and login functionality, with secure password handling and session management. The frontend, created with React, provides a dynamic and intuitive user interface, seamlessly integrating with the backend API. This application is deployed on Vercel, making it easily accessible and scalable for production use.
